# Artemis-Financial
Artemis Financial is a financial comapny wanting to modernize they current web-based software application. They would like us to implement and apply the most current and effective software security. I implemented hash functions into they software to encrypt it making it unreadable to anyone that does not have a access to the decryption key for security purposes. The most challenging part of the vulnerability assessment in my opinion was checking each vulnerability to see what it was. The need to add layers of security depends on the value of the items you are trying to secure in this case it being a financial company the information stored holds quite the value, therefore we need to have good security to ensure the safety of our software. Here we ran dependency checks to check for vulnerabilities in the code and I will definitely be using this method in future projects because it was simple and very beneficial. After refactoring our code we ran another dependency check to make sure we hadn't introduced any new vulnerabilties in while adjusting stuff. In this particular project I would showcase my vulnerability report at the end because it would show the employer that we have no vulnerabilities.
